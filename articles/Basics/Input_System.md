# Input System

Press buttons. Do things.

### Use the Directional Pad

Mortal Kombat X is most efficiently played
with the directional-pad when on controller. Analogue stick will
lead to slower inputs and difficulty dashing and running.
Do not treat this as a matter of preference. Use the directional
pad, not the analogue stick. You will play much better as a result.

### "Dial a Kombo"

A big quirk of the Mortal Kombat X input system is commonly known
as "Dial a Kombo". Simply put, the timing of your inputs do not mirror
the timing of your characters actions. If your character would do a
sequence of three punches, you do not press a button _as each punch is thrown_.
Instead, you press all three buttons in rapid sequence and your character then
executes the sequence. Similar to "dialing" on a phone.

At first, this may seem very uncomfortable as it demands your inputs be
much quicker than other fighting games. Pressing the second punch after
the first one has come out will be considered a late input. However, this
system is easier in the sense you do not need to concern yourself with
the precise timing of your inputs. Compare this to Street Fighter where
it is easy to miss "links" because you pressed the second punch 1/10th of
a second too early or too late. In the "Dial a Kombo" system so long as you
input the correct sequence the entire string will come out.

[EXAMPLE VIDEO]

In the above video, you can see. The general rule is the input for the next
part of the string must be in **before** the **startup** of the previous move
in the string is over.

It is not possible to dial in inputs **too** quickly. So long as the order and number
is correct, your character will catch up to you. So do your string puts as quickly
as possible until it becomes second nature. You should think of a string and mentally
see it as a single input.
