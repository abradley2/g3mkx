# Input System

Press buttons. Do things.

### Use the Directional Pad

Mortal Kombat X is most efficiently played
with the directional-pad when on controller. Analogue stick will
lead to slower inputs and difficulty dashing and running.
Do not treat this as a matter of preference. Use the directional
pad, not the analogue stick. You will play much better as a result.
