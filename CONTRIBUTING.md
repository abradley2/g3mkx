# So, you'd like to help?
AWESOME!

Fork this repo, clone, and edit away. Most of what you'll need to do to
contribute is in the **articles** directory. Alongside any pull request you submit, 
please include your attribution details for the AUTHORS file so you can be 
given credit for your work. This includes you name or chosen alias, and optionally
a point of contact such as e-mail.

## Adding an articles

I've tried to keep this as accessible as possible so people can 
contribute without any knowledge of code. However, if you are adding
an article instead of editing on already included, you will need to
add some very basic HTML to **index.html**.


## Article media content

For now, all media content should be hoested on imgur or gfycat.
